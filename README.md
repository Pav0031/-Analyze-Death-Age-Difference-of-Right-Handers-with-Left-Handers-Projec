# Final Report: Analyzing Death Age Difference of Right Handers with Left Handers
#### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the difference in the age at death between right-handed and left-handed individuals. Utilizing data from a National Geographic survey in 1986 and death distribution data for the United States from 1999, we aim to investigate whether there is a significant discrepancy in the average age at death between these two groups. By leveraging Bayesian statistics and data visualization techniques, we explore the impact of changing rates of left-handedness over time on mortality patterns.

#### Introduction 
About the Company
MedTourEasy is a global healthcare company specializing in providing informational resources for evaluating global healthcare options. The company offers analytical solutions to partner healthcare providers worldwide.

#### About the Project
In this project, we delve into the phenomenon of early death among left-handed individuals. By analyzing age distribution data, we aim to investigate the reported age gap between left-handed and right-handed individuals. Using Bayesian statistics, we assess the impact of changing rates of left-handedness on mortality patterns over time.

#### Objectives and Deliverables

* Objectives:

Investigate the impact of changing rates of left-handedness on the observed age gap between left-handed and right-handed individuals.
Assess the implications of increasing rates of left-handedness over time for the longevity of left-handed individuals.
Evaluate potential factors contributing to the observed differences in age at death between left-handed and right-handed individuals, including societal attitudes and demographic shifts.

* Deliverables:

Analysis of the relationship between changing rates of left-handedness and differences in age at death between left-handed and right-handed individuals.
Interpretation of findings regarding the potential impact of increasing left-handedness rates on the longevity of left-handed individuals, providing insights into health outcomes associated with handedness.

Discussion of the role of societal attitudes and demographic trends in shaping observed differences in age at death, highlighting the complex interplay of biological and social factors.

#### Language Used: Python

Tools and Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, numpy

#### Conclusion & Future Scope
* Conclusions:
1. Observed significant differences in mortality rates between left-handed and right-handed individuals.
2.  Investigated the impact of changing rates of left-handedness on mortality patterns.
3.  Identified potential factors influencing age at death discrepancies.
* Future Scope:
1. Refinement of data analysis techniques for more accurate results.
2. Comparative studies across different populations for broader insights.
3. Application of findings in healthcare policy and product development.
